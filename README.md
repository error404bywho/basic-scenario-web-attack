# Student Profile Website - Security Overview

## Introduction

This document provides a brief overview of the **Student Profile Website**, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities that may expose the application to exploitation. The website allows students to manage personal profiles, upload profile pictures, and view academic information. However, certain security weaknesses may leave it susceptible to malicious attacks. 

## Potential Vulnerabilities

The following vulnerabilities have been identified as risks in the current implementation of the Student Profile Website:

### 1. SQL Injection

SQL Injection allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries by inserting malicious input, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive student data. Without proper input validation, attackers can exploit login forms and other query-based inputs to access or alter database content.

### 2. File Upload Vulnerability

The profile picture upload feature may allow users to upload arbitrary files without strict file-type validation. This can be exploited to upload malicious scripts disguised as image files, which could then be executed on the server.

### 3. Path Traversal

Path Traversal occurs when an application does not properly sanitize file paths, enabling attackers to access files outside the intended directory. Attackers could potentially retrieve sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files or database credentials, by manipulating file paths.

### 4. OS Command Injection

OS Command Injection allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized command execution, granting attackers full control over the system if exploited.

## Summary

The Student Profile Website requires careful attention to input validation and security controls to mitigate these vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues will improve the integrity and safety of student data within the application.
